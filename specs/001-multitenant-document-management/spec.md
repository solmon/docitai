3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: WARN "Implementation choices noted as options"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid low-level HOW (frameworks, code; accept high-level integration options)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders and product managers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Key Entities, Review & Acceptance Checklist
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely

### Notes about implementation options
This spec lists functional requirements and high-level options where the user provided them (e.g., supported storage providers, search engine choices). Final implementation choices (exact provider, auth method, index engine) are [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] and will be decided during planning.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a tenant administrator I want to upload, organize, and control access to documents within my tenant so that teams can securely collaborate while keeping tenant data isolated from other customers.

As an editor I want to upload and tag documents, move them between folders, and search across my tenant's documents so I can find and share knowledge quickly.

As a viewer I want to preview documents inline and download permitted files so I can consume content without unnecessary friction.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a tenant admin and an empty tenant workspace, **When** the admin uploads a document to /Root/DeptX/ProjectY and tags it with metadata, **Then** the document is stored, metadata saved, and visible to users with view permission.

2. **Given** a folder with inherited permissions (Viewer on parent), **When** a child folder overrides permissions to add Editor, **Then** users with Editor on child may upload while parent-only Viewers cannot.

3. **Given** a user selects 10 documents and requests a bulk download, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** a ZIP is generated containing the requested files and a manifest of metadata and access checks were enforced for every file.

4. **Given** an audit requirement, **When** any user performs Upload/Delete/View/Search, **Then** an AuditEvent containing user ID, tenant ID, timestamp, IP, document ID, action type, and request context is stored in the centralized audit store.

### Edge Cases
- Upload of extremely large files (e.g., >100GB): describe acceptable limits and chunking strategy [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file size limits].
- Concurrent permission updates while active file operations occur: ensure transactional permission checks; define failure modes.
- Storage provider outage: system should surface degraded mode and retry/queue writes to alternate provider if configured (operational detail to plan).
- Name collisions across tenants: tenant isolation must prevent cross-tenant collisions even if object keys collide at storage layer.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001 — Multitenancy**: System MUST logically isolate tenant data, metadata, and access controls so no tenant can access another tenant's documents or metadata.

- **FR-002 — Tenant Context Propagation**: System MUST accept and propagate a tenant context with every request (token/header/session) and enforce it across storage, search, and audit subsystems.

- **FR-003 — Shared Application Layer**: System MUST run a single codebase supporting per-tenant configuration (feature flags, storage mapping, branding) without mixing tenant data.

- **FR-004 — Document Categorization**: System MUST support hierarchical folders/categories (Root → Department → Project) with arbitrary depth and allow attaching metadata tags to documents.

- **FR-005 — Metadata Tags**: System MUST allow tenant-configurable tags and indexed metadata fields to support faceted search and filtering.

- **FR-006 — RBAC (Roles & Permissions)**: System MUST support roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) and map those to granular permissions (upload, delete, view, search, manage-permissions).

- **FR-007 — ACLs at Folder Level**: System MUST allow ACLs to be applied at folder/category level for users and groups, with permission checks performed per operation.

- **FR-008 — Permission Inheritance & Override**: Permissions MUST cascade from parent to child folders by default and allow explicit overrides at child nodes; the effective permission calculation must be deterministic and auditable.

- **FR-009 — Pluggable Storage Abstraction**: System MUST provide a storage adapter interface to read/write/delete binary objects; it MUST be possible to configure providers per-tenant (Azure Blob, AWS S3, GCS). Implementation choices (provider selection) are left to planning.

- **FR-010 — Upload/Delete Operations**: System MUST support single and bulk upload and delete operations with atomicity guarantees documented for bulk flows (e.g., best-effort with per-object audit and partial-failure handling).

- **FR-011 — View & Preview**: System MUST enable inline preview for supported document types (PDF, images, plain text); preview generation may be asynchronous and must respect tenant ACLs.

- **FR-012 — Search (Metadata)**: System MUST support metadata-driven search across tenant documents (filename, tags, uploader, date, folder) with faceted filtering.

- **FR-013 — Search (Full-text)**: System SHOULD support optional full-text indexing and search via an indexing service; the choice of engine (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) is an implementation decision [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: preferred engine].

- **FR-014 — Bulk Upload/Download**: System MUST accept bulk uploads (ZIP or batch API) and support bulk downloads by generating a ZIP with a manifest; operations must validate access per-file.

- **FR-015 — Audit Trail**: System MUST log Upload/Delete/View/Search events with user ID, tenant ID, timestamp, IP address, document ID, action type, and relevant request context into a centralized audit store (e.g., relational DB or document DB).

- **FR-016 — Audit Retention & Export**: System MUST provide configurable retention policies for audit logs and export capabilities for SIEM integration. Retention duration is [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention policy].

- **FR-017 — Performance & Scalability**: System MUST scale to support multi-tenant load with isolation; define performance targets (requests/sec, indexing throughput, median latency) in planning [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance SLAs].

- **FR-018 — Security & Compliance**: System MUST authenticate and authorize all requests; encryption in transit is mandatory; encryption at rest is required where supported by provider. Specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) are [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: compliance scope].

- **FR-019 — Monitoring & Alerting**: System MUST emit operational metrics (storage errors, queue backlogs, search index lag, audit write failures) and support alerting for critical failures.

- **FR-020 — Operational Controls**: System MUST provide tenant admin operations: invite/remove users, manage roles/groups, configure storage mapping, and run tenant-scoped exports.

### Non-functional Requirements (high level)
- Isolation and data protection are top priority for tenant separation.
- System should be highly available (RPO/RTO to be defined).
- Privilege escalation must be prevented; admin actions must be auditable.

### Ambiguities & Open Decisions
- Authentication/Identity provider: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how are users authenticated — internal accounts, SSO, OAuth, SAML?]
- Search engine selection (Elasticsearch vs OpenSearch): [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Audit retention period and export formats: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- File size limits, chunking strategy, and streaming vs buffered uploads: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
